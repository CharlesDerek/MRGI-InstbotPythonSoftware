# Instabot.py ü§ñ üåü

**Instabot.py** is an extremely light instagram bot that uses the undocumented Web API. Unlike other bots, Instabot.py does _not_ require Selenium or a WebDriver. Instead, it interacts with the API over simple HTTP Requests. It runs on most systems, including Raspberry Pi.

## Required:

- Python v3.6 or greater
- Pip v18 or greater

## Quick Start üöÄ

- **Make sure you have Python 3.6 or above installed**

  - `python3 --version`

On Windows you might have to use `python` without the version (`3`) suffix. Experienced users should use virtualenv.

- **If your version is below 3.6, we recommend you install the latest Python 3.7**

  - [Python on Windows](https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/wiki/Installing-Python-on-Windows)
  - [Python on Mac](https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/wiki/Installing-Python-3.7-on-macOS)
  - [Python on Raspberry Raspbian / Debian / Ubuntu](https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/wiki/Installing-Python-3.7-on-Raspberry-Pi)

- **Install instabot.py from PyPi repository**

  - `python3 -m pip install instabot-py`

- **Start the bot** üèÅ

  - `instabot-py` or `python3 -m instabot_py`
  - `instabot-py -c myconfiguration.yml` or `python3 -m instabot_py -c myconfiguration.yml`
  - `instabot-interactive` to use the legacy interactive mode (deprecated and will be removed soon)

- ** Configuration  ** ‚öôÔ∏è

By running `instabot-py`,  the Bot reads its configuration from instabot.config.yml in your current directory.
you can run the bot with a different configuration `instabot-py -c myconfiguration.yml`


- **Legacy Interactive Mode (DEPRECATED)** ‚öôÔ∏è

When you first run `instabot-py -i` a file called `config.ini` will be created in your current directory, along with an SQLite DB.

After the initial configuration, you can manually edit `config.ini` with a text editor. Restart the bot for changes to take effect.

The `%username%.db` file contains a record of the posts the bot has liked, and the users it has followed/unfollowed.

The `%username%.session` file stores your session with Instagram to avoid re-logins each time you start the bot.

## Upgrade ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

- `python3 -m pip install instabot-py --no-cache-dir --upgrade`
- `pip3 install instabot-py --no-cache-dir --upgrade`

## Install methods

**Recommended: From PyPi:** (Stable)

- `python3 -m pip install instabot-py`

**From sources:**  (Bleeding edge)

- `python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py`
